# Ansible

Ansible roles and playbook to manage my servers.

I used to do everything by hand because it's fun, but it is too many servers and I want to focus on what's important = building stuff rather than spending hours keeping everything running.

## Roles

Because I want to learn more of Ansible, I am currently using local roles instead of roles from Ansible Galaxy. In future I would like to migrate to Galaxy.
